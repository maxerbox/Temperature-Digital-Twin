AI-enabled dashboard builder and free open-source alternative to Geckoboard, based on the original Freeboard static dashboard project.

Agent Freeboard is a browser-based dashboard editor and viewer for JSON, MQTT, playback, clock, Dweet.io, OpenWeatherMap, and other plugin-backed data sources. It keeps the original useful idea: dashboards are plain client-side HTML/CSS/JS, so they can be served as static files, embedded in small systems, or dropped behind your own auth/storage layer.

This fork exists because the original hosted product and old demo links are gone. The product direction is intentionally practical: static and agent-generated dashboards you can host anywhere, plus a small local/project save mode when you want the editor to write a dashboard JSON file back to disk. The aim is modern build tooling, clean static serving, useful examples, safer verification, editor polish, and agent-friendly automation without turning Agent Freeboard into a heavy hosted SaaS app.

## Current Status

- Node.js 20+ supported
- Node.js 22 used for local development
- Grunt 1.x build chain
- `npm audit` clean at the maintained dependency layer
- Static Docker image served by nginx and published to GHCR
- GitHub Actions CI for Node 20 and 22
- Maintained bundled demo dashboard
- Static asset and example-dashboard verification
- First canvas-first editor affordances: inline pane titles and on-canvas add-widget controls
- Bundled MQTT datasource using the Eclipse Paho browser client
- Agent-oriented CLI for validating, creating, deploying, and locally saving dashboard bundles

## Build Proof

The GitHub Actions build runs on every push and pull request, plus manual dispatch. It installs dependencies with `npm ci` and runs `npm run verify` on Node.js 20 and 22. Verification audits maintained dependencies, rebuilds distributable bundles, checks static asset references, validates bundled dashboard examples, and exercises the `agent-freeboard` CLI validate/create/deploy path and the local Project Save Mode write endpoint.

## Demo

Run it locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run serve
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/#source=examples/freeboard-demo.json
```

Or run the Docker/nginx preview:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8003/#source=examples/freeboard-demo.json
```

## What It Includes

Agent Freeboard provides:

- a draggable pane/grid dashboard layout
- a browser editor for datasources, panes, and widgets
- serializable dashboard JSON
- bundled datasource plugins: JSON, OpenWeatherMap, Dweet.io, Playback, Clock, Octoblu, MQTT
- bundled widget plugins: Text, Gauge, Sparkline, Pointer, Indicator, Traffic Light, Picture, Google Map, HTML
- plugin loading for custom datasource and widget scripts
- static build artifacts for simple hosting

It does not include hosted accounts, sharing, auth, or a multi-user database. If you need those, put Agent Freeboard behind your own application shell and use `freeboard.serialize()` / `freeboard.loadDashboard()`. For local project editing, use Project Save Mode below.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeoStehlik/agent-freeboard.git
cd agent-freeboard
npm install
npm run build
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run verify
```

`npm run verify` runs an npm audit, rebuilds distributable CSS and JavaScript bundles, checks that HTML/CSS static asset references resolve, and validates bundled example dashboards.

## Agent CLI

The first agent-facing interface is a small Node CLI. It gives automation a stable way to validate dashboards, create dashboards from a compact spec, and package a static deployable bundle.

```bash
npm run agent-freeboard -- validate examples/freeboard-demo.json
npm run agent-freeboard -- create examples/agent-dashboard-spec.json --out .artifacts/agent-dashboard.json
npm run agent-freeboard -- deploy .artifacts/agent-dashboard.json --out .artifacts/agent-dashboard-site
```

The generated site opens at:

```text
.artifacts/agent-dashboard-site/index.html#source=dashboard.json
```

Project Save Mode serves the app locally and lets the editor write the selected dashboard JSON file back to disk:

```bash
npm run agent-freeboard -- serve examples/office-dashboard-editable.json --port 8080 --write
```

Then open the URL printed by the command. By default it binds to `127.0.0.1`; if you bind write mode to another host, treat it as a trusted-network tool.

The compact spec is intentionally boring JSON so agents, MCP tools, scripts, and CI jobs can emit it without needing to understand every Freeboard widget field. A metric looks like:

```json
{
  "pane": "Service Health",
  "title": "Uptime",
  "value": "datasources[\"Demo API\"].system.uptime_percent",
  "kind": "gauge",
  "min": 95,
  "max": 100,
  "units": "%"
}
```

This CLI is the first product slice toward an API/MCP surface. The next clean layer is to wrap the same commands as MCP tools rather than inventing a separate dashboard contract.

## Static Serving

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080/
```

## Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8003/
```

The Container workflow publishes the standalone repository image to GitHub Container Registry as `ghcr.io/leostehlik/agent-freeboard-standalone:latest`. The original `ghcr.io/leostehlik/agent-freeboard` package name may still be attached to the archived fork package permissions. After the standalone package is public, run:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8003:80 ghcr.io/leostehlik/agent-freeboard-standalone:latest
```

## Dashboard JSON

Load a dashboard by URL hash:

```text
http://localhost:8080/#source=examples/freeboard-demo.json
```

A dashboard can also be loaded programmatically:

```javascript
freeboard.loadDashboard(configuration, function() {
    freeboard.setEditing(false);
});
```

## MQTT Datasource

The bundled MQTT datasource uses a local Eclipse Paho browser client and connects to MQTT brokers over WebSockets.

Settings:

- `Broker WebSocket URL`: `ws://` or `wss://` broker URL. `%HOST%` expands to the current page host. `%WS%` expands to `ws` or `wss` based on the current page protocol.
- `Client ID`: base client ID; a random suffix is added per browser session.
- `Topics`: one or more topics to subscribe to. MQTT wildcards are allowed.

Payload behavior:

- JSON payloads are parsed into objects.
- Plain text payloads become `{ payload: "..." }`.
- MQTT v5 `userProperties` are copied onto the payload object.
- The datasource exposes a `connected` boolean.

## Calculated Values

Calculated widget fields still accept JavaScript expressions against `datasources`.

Simple example:

```javascript
datasources["Demo API"].service.error_rate
```

For deeper JSON where long bracket chains get awkward, use `freeboard.selectPath(data, path)`.

```javascript
freeboard.selectPath(datasources["Demo API"], "/service/error_rate")
```

`selectPath` supports JSON Pointer-style `/a/b/0` paths for plain objects and arrays. If passed a DOM node or document, it evaluates the path as browser XPath and returns a scalar value or an array of matching node text values.

## API

All API calls are made on the `freeboard` singleton object.

## Building Plugins

See `docs/plugin_example.html` for the original plugin example. Custom plugins can also be loaded from the in-app Developer Console.

## Testing Plugins

Edit `index.html` and add your plugin script near the `head.js` loader:

```javascript
head.js("js/freeboard_plugins.min.js",
    "path/to/my/plugin/file.js",
    function() {
        $(function() {
            freeboard.initialize(true);
        });
    });
```
